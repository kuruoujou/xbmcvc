Spencer's TODO list:

- Make XBMC Usernames and Passwords work
- Switch from HTTP Api to EventClient, as HTTP is deprecated. Seriously so.
- Make xbmcvc use a config file, so users can create their own words
	- will download words from cmu sphinx's page, so that they don't have to search on their own
